# DataScienceProg2-project

It was a project of the subject Data Science Programming 2. 
The project required us to find the relationship between climate and crop yield using R and online dataset available.
The scope is limited to one crop. We pick the cereal type. The data source is from FAO, and its region is at Malaysia.

In our analysis, we found the fertilizer effect of carbon dioxide on the crop yield.
